# elemental-elements
A text based program which provides information about the elements and some other items.
This was a project for the end of the fall semester of 2019 for a chemistry class I took. The goal was to create something which demonstrated our knowledge.
Thankfully, I was able to write a program for it!

The original goal was to create a program that would provide an interactive interface to display information about the elements on the periodic table.
Additionally, it was also designed to calculate the mass of molecules and balance chemical equations, the latter, however was not achieved due to time constraints.

In its current state, it simply prints a bunch of information which it is staticly programmed to do (there is no user interaction). This will be changing soon though...
